		<h2>Why Committee Flow?</h2>
    <p>The work of committees is central to the functioning of both the House and the Senate. Therefore, it is potentially useful to be able to take a broad view of how bills proceed (or fail to
      proceed) through those committees. </p>
    <h2>How it works</h2>
    <p>Analysts from the <a href="http://www.loc.gov/crsinfo/about/">Congressional Research Service</a> look at each bill and resolution and assign them terms from two controlled vocabularies:
      <a href="https://www.congress.gov/help/field-values/policy-area">Policy Area terms</a> and <a href="https://www.congress.gov/help/field-values/legislative-subject-terms">
      Legislative Subject Terms</a>. The former is a broad overview of the topic of a bill (only one heading is assigned), while the latter is much more granular, though less
      easy to browse.</p>
    <p>Using the <a href="https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/bulkdata/BILLSTATUS">bulk bill status system</a>, information for individual bills is downloaded and analyzed. Progress of bills through the
      committee system is tracked and correlated with the policy areas and subject headings noted above. Finally, a series of Sankey diagrams are constructed with the resulting data.</p>
      <h2>Caveats</h2>
        <p>For the sake of simplicity, only committees (and not subcommittees) are shown on the diagrams. As bill status data is manually downloaded, activity for the most recent congress may be slightly out-of-date.<p>

  	<h3>Technologies</h3>
		<p>Committee Flow is powered by JavaScript and <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a>. The script for analyzing bill status data is written in <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a>. Govinfo does not have a public API as yet, so a custom webservice
      is used to fetch the JSON that provides the yearly counts. <a href="https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/gallery/barchart">Google Charts</a>
      is used to draw the charts and responsive layout is made easier with <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a>.</p>
